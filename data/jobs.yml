    During my last three months at gizra, I worked at RealCommerce as a team leader and extra three months as a
    freelance. Since I knew Drupal very good I helped a Drupal based team inside the company to handle various tasks:
    fix bugs, implements new features, update the design and make sure that the \"best practice\" is implemented.

  position: Lead developer
  description: "
    I joined gizra in June 2011, after working in Pizza Hut as a shift manager.
    I had no real experience and until then all my coding stuff was a hobie.
    At the beginning I worked on a couple of projects but eventually I worked on a QA site for medical questions for a
    year and a half. Later on I worked on other projects until I joined an open source project called
    OpenScholar. The work on OS took around 4-5 years in which I lead developers, handled complex tasks, helped to
    implement CI/CD projects, and worked directly with the team from Harvard. Except for that, most of the work in gizra
    based on contribution from the opensource community so it was natural, and the right thing to do, to give back to
    the community: I talked on local meetups, created modules in Drupal, managed local events, mentored young developers
    and much more.
