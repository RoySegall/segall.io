  intro: "
  I love Apple products but mostly, what I use every day for making money, is an operating system. I love Mac OSX, I
  think it’s one of the best OS for web development. No, Microsoft Windows is not good enough IMO for web development.
  One of the things that doesn’t exist on the Mac OS is a proper image gallery.

  So what is a bot? If you’ve ever said Hey Siri, OK Google, Hey Cortona, or Alexa, then you have interacted with a bot.
  That bot received an input, returned an output - it woke you up, reminded you of something, sent an email, or ordered
  a new book from Amazon - and you if you’re lucky, a drone delivered it!

  intro: "
  For a traditional Drupal site, we don’t need to handle authentication, because Drupal has our back - a user submits
  the login form, gets a cookie, and starts using the awesome site. But what about decoupled sites? How can we
  authenticate the user?

  intro: "
  Drupal-8-manina is at its highest. Modules are being ported, blog posts are being written, and new sites are being
  coded, so we in Gizra decided to join the party.

  We started with a simple site that will replace an existing static site. But we needed to migrate node attachments,
  and we just couldn’t find an existing solution. Well, it was time to reach out to the community

  intro: "
  You might have heard of Burning Man. Basically it’s a lot of hippies settling down in the desert for a few days,
  setting up small camps with different themes that make up a big, temporary city.

  It’s not for me.
