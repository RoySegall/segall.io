# About me

## History

I was born on June 25th, 1989. When I was 12 years old, I started to work on sites related to my interest: Games and TV 
shows. When I was 13 years old I joined a local community which supported and translated [Invision power board]() system. In 
the meanwhile, I created scripts for fun.

In Israel, there is conscription which forced me to join the `IDF`. At the age of 21, when I left the army I started to 
work in `Pizza Hu`t as a shift manager but felt that this is not the best fit me for. I quit and started to look for a 
job in the web world. `gizra` decided to hire me and to teach me all the knew in the tech world, and Drupal specifically. 
I started a joiner, moved to lead developer and finally I was a lead developer.

After 7 years at `gizra`, I decided to quit since I was too much in the comfort zone - and that’s not a good thing. I 
worked with `Real commerce` as a team leader and then joined `Taliaz`. In `taliaz` I was a single developer, alongside the 
CTO, and solved various problems.

## Computerised dreams
Once upon a day, I decided to have a cool email address. I look for the domain `segall.com` but this was taken. So I 
looked for other domains and eventually found `segall.io`. If you want to use Google’s services with a custom domain you 
need to register as a business. I thought of a cool name and found out that Computerised dreams is pretty awesome.

It’s not just a name - it’s a way of creating products and solutions. Every time someone approaches me and asked me on 
how his app should look or act, or maybe a customer had an idea but never knew how to describe it I use to give them the 
next tip: Close your eyes and start to imagine how your up should look like. How your brand new site looks and behaves 
in your deepest dreams.

My mission, as a developer and someone that knows a thing or two about computers is to take your wildest dreams and turn 
them to something real.

This is why I choose this name.
