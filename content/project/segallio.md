#### Background
For a long time I desired to own a personal site in which I can write all about the stuff I'm doing and done, preset my 
CV in a better way and sell my self better. At the beginning I thought of collection data from any social network 
oriented site but it was to complex. Instead, I went with a static site generator.

This is the story of `segall.io`.

#### The idea

So, At first I thought of using `Drupal`. `Drupal` is a CMS in which I used for something like 7 years. But, as I 
started to model the data, creating the theme layer, and starting to query the DB in the best way so it would be 
a site that load very fast I saw that it's to much for personal site and the time I'm spending it is too high. So I 
forgot about the site. I have linkedin which people can see my CV and that's pretty much pretty good for now.

After a while I said to my self that I'm probably going to be a freelance developer someday, and that computerised 
dreams is a good name(and I had an awesome logo) I said to myself: "Let's start with segall.io one more time.". So, I 
started to look on the technologies available, and remembered that `gizra`'s [site](http://www.gizra.com) - a company in 
which I worked at - used a static site generator as well I thought that could a nice solution for me as well.

I remembered that `hugo` is a super fast static site generator and started to work on the site. The results you can see 
now and it's remarkable how easy and nice the experience is.

#### My two cents on the stack

`hugo` is an awesome site generator. In compare to jekyll, which seems to me that was the default choice in this 
category, the installation was pretty easy. `jekyll` created in `ruby` and most of the times I did not had a good 
experience with `jekyll`: the ruby version is not matching, and then you need to install `bundler` and it never went 
smooth for me.

On the other hand, installing `hugo` was awesome: I installed it with `brew` and that's it - I'm ready to start write my
site. After watching a couple of videos from 
[introduction to Hugo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3) by 
`Mike Dane`, the documentation on the official site, and the questions from the discussion board I created my personal 
site in just a couple of days.
