#### Background
For a long time, I desired to own a personal site in which I can write all about the stuff I'm doing and did, present my 
CV in a better way and sell my self better. In the beginning, I thought of collecting data from any social network 
oriented site but it was to complex. Instead, I went with a static site generator.

This is the story of `segall.io`.

#### The idea
So, At first, I thought of using `Drupal`. `Drupal` is a CMS in which I used for something like 7 years. It's suited 
best for the mission: collecting a lot of data from Github, Facebook, and Twitter but, as I started to model the data, 
creating the theme layer, and starting to query the DB and handle a lot of data sets at once(a tweet from twitter, 
status from Facebook, image from Instagram, etc. etc.) I saw that it's too much for a personal site and the time I'm 
spending it is too high. So, I forgot about the site. I have a LinkedIn profile which people can see my CV and is pretty 
much pretty good for now.

After a while, I said to my self: `I'm probably going to be a freelance developer someday, computerised dreams is a good 
name and I had an awesome logo. So... Let's start with segall.io one more time.`. I remembered that `Hugo` is a super 
fast static site generator and started to work on the site. The results you can see now, and it's remarkable how easy 
and nice the experience is.

#### My two cents on the stack
`hugo` is an awesome site generator when comparing to jekyll, which seems to me as the default choice in this category. 
The installation was pretty easy. `jekyll` created in `ruby` and most of the times I did not have a good experience with 
`jekyll`: the ruby version is not matching, and then you need to install `bundler` and it never went smooth for me.

On the other hand, installing `hugo` was awesome: I installed it with `brew` and that's it - I'm ready to start writing 
my site. After watching a couple of videos from 
[introduction to Hugo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3) by 
`Mike Dane`, the documentation on the official site, and the questions from the discussion board I created my personal 
site in just a couple of days.
