#### Background
While I worked at `gizra` there was a need for creating a chat bot in `slack`. My first weapon of choice was `PHP` 
because this is what most of the developers, and our products, are using. I needed to choose a language that mose of the
developers know for any case.

I looked for some frameworks because I might not be the first developer that needed something like that. The problem was
that none of the solution I found was good enough. Yes, they had a lot of stars but the work with them, and the 
architecture was not my cup of tea. So, I asked my self what I need to do and I remembered in of the rules we had at 
`gizra` is that if you don't find something that suite you - write it your self. And that's what I did. I created 
something small that later on will grow to something bigger. Bigger that what I could imaging.

#### The idea

So first, why that name? In order to do that let's turn on our delorean time machine and had back a couple of years. I
had an ephiphiny - let's create a chat system that will be fully modular: the backend could be in any language, the 
front end could be in any language but the only thing that matters is that will speak in the same way. Some kind of a 
protocol. I choose the name `nuntius` which means messaging in Latin. The idea was too big for one person but the name
saved in my heart.

When I came to scale the small script too something bigger `nuntius` was a good choice. It sound very exotic and 
probably no one would know what it really means. 

So, really nuntius give us that something else not? First, ease of development and elgancy in writing your for what you
need to handle: text recognition, setting up dev environment, documentation that would be easy to read and with a very 
detailed code examples, a DB layer that can abstracted to any DB there is, entity system and much more.

The idea developed into something big and I bought a domain. I started to work on version 2.0 that will be much more big
than what we have now: modules system, better caching layer, better entity system, plugins, and much more.

#### My two cents on the stack
