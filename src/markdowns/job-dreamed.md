2018 was a rough year. I quit my job, and then I found another job which I
loved very much. Then, I got fired. Here I was, looking for a job, again. Took
me a couple of months but I found it. It was a, pardon my french, crappy job.
It was so bad I rather not talk about it, and delete any reference of me being
employed there. After three months I decided to quit and look for another jbo.

This time, I knew what I was looking for and the search was grueling, each
place was not interested in my skills or it was something I did not want to
do. But then, like a ray of sunshine between a crack of clouds from gray sky
I found it - my next, and current position, at _Dreamed Diabetes_.

Very similar to the previous job on the list, _Taliaz_, the work in
_Dreamed Diabetes_ is all about doing good: Helping people with
_Diabetes_ to live better. It doing by getting their diabetes
information, process it with a smart algorythim and then provide a treatment
plan which improve, and might saves, the patient's life. Surely, something
not everyone can vouch for himself.

The work in _Dreamed Diabetes_ is done in technologies I could dreamed
of at the time: _Python_ and _React_, which thrilles me a lot.
But, not only the technologies makes me happy - there's so much more. Seeing
how people really lives with diabetes and understanding that there's more than
just inject them self _Insulin_ was shocking. I won't go deep but I can
say that there's a hole new world that invailed to me, something that don't
teach you a lot in schools and that's a shame.

We talked about the technical stuff, let's talk a bit about the people - wow!
It's been a while since I found place that keep so much smart people in one
place (well, they have to if they doing such a noble goal). But besides of
them being smart I can say that they really heart-warming, bear-care people
with the feet on the ground. I do believe I found a place that will forever
stay in my heart.
