At my last 3 months over _gizra_ I got a bonus from my CTO, _Amitai_: Another project company needed help with a _Drupal_ based project and I was sent to the task. It was something that I did with a customer in the past, _Harvard_, which I need to do two stuff: consulting with issues which related to _Drupal_ and managed other employee and help them to maintain the project.

It was a very special time period for me: I was looking for a job and went to job interviews but yet, I was doing consulting for another company which I know nothing about their organization workflow. It felt to me that I need to join to another company, become a one of their oen for very short period time but still keep my eyes open for my next long term preofessional relationship.

From the social prespective they were good, really! I felt I was at home and love the people. From my professional prespective I couldn't take it anymore - another _Drupal_ project that has no CI nor automated tests. But, the team, project manager and the CTO was very helpful and even propose me a poisition. I declined because I was looking fo r something else.

Each company Iv'e been to, even for a short period, I take the good stuff and try to look how it impacted me. From _Real Commerce_ I took the ability to look beyond to simple developer point of view and can see how the feature, or the lack of infrastructure can hurt our development, got a better understand how _Drupal_ can help big organizations in these days, especially when there are cool technologies like _NodeJS_.
