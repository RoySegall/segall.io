It true, I havn't been on a lot of companies over the years. I 'spent' 7 years at _gizra_ while other people are able to work at at lest 3 companies. But on the other hand, working for a company for 7 streat years indicate on loyaltee for your employee, it's a bonus. But for my case a lot of compnies decided that my exprience is not what they looking and skips to the next contendent.

_Taliaz_ is a different story. After being sick and tired for looking for a job a friend told me that he knows someone that look for a fullstack developer. I gave it a shot. The process was very quick and I felt that that company is different from the other companies Iv'e been to while I looked for my next job. It was a small startup which started the expansion process from hiring two people to something bigger.

It was exactly something I was looking for. Being at a position where you can make a real impact. No longer a project with a company that after 1-2 years you don't have any relationship and the hard work you gave are not visible to your eyes. If I can describe it, it's like saying goodbye from one of your childrens.

At _Taliaz_ I was given the honor at starting to re-write the product. Choosing the backend (Symfony in my case) while the frontend will be choosen sometime in the future. At the begining, I was looking for approval to do stuff. My CTO told me that I don't need and he said: 'Just build it. If it will not fit, we remove it'. Then, something happend - a switch was turned on. From being regular to wait for approval I needed to act fast and if something was bad, that's OK, we'll fix it and learn for the next time.

But, it turns that nothing good was last forever and in my case, shoter than I ever expected. After two months, just when I started to warm up I got the bad news - I'm fired. It's not because I was they were out of money - the funding they were looking for has not arrived.

P.S - I forgot to tell your what's _Taliaz_ purpose in this cosmos we exists in: _Taliaz_ came up with an incredible solution - helping to people with depression to find the best matching medicine with less side effects. That job fit me well because I love 'doing good' for other people.
