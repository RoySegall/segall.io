      <p>During my work at <b>gizra</b> there was a need to create an
      integration to the slack. The problem is that I could not find any good
      PHP framework for creating bots. So I created one.
      </p>

      <p>
      The framework provided some cool feature like a DB layer, service
      container and a couple of practices which I took from the <b>Symfony</b>
      library.
