  After I got fired from Taliaz I started to look for a Job once more. The job search took around 3 months and I nailed
  a position in company I rather not specify. I decided to hide it from my resume since the job position was at a
  company that had nothing in which I believe: No CI, No PR and code reviews and not a single good principle for a
  project managing. After an unpleasant event that occur I decided to quit it and look for a better job.

  I arrived finally to Dreamed Diabetes, a company which developed an algorithm that can suggest a better insulin plans
  for patients with Type 1 Diabetes. This time I look for the right signals - All the best practices, a good challenge,
  Technologies I did not worked with, and a work life balance.

  In addition to all of the above there was one thing that I decided to pick this position - getting out of my comfort
  zone. Dreamed uses Windows as the OS for developing and the stack is ReactJS with Django. Technologies I did not had
  the chance to work with. The very best thing with getting of the comfort zone is that you get to do stuff you did not
  thought of before.

    Once I figured out I had enough with Drupal I joined a company called Taliaz. Taliaz's mission was to help people
    with hard depression. They managed to accomplish that by taking a swab sample from the patient, ask the patient a
    couple of questions, and after a couple of days the patient(or the doctor) will get a report with the best matching
    medicine. At the time I joined in, Taliaz decided to grow in start to develop all the products in-house instead of
    using an out-source solution. I helped to improve the current products: fix bugs, implement a couple of small
    features. In the last month at Taliaz, I started to write a new API based on Symfony which meant to serve all kind
    of application: Desktop, Mobile, Smart wearable devices etc.

    I got fired from Taliaz due to finance issues they had back then - pretty typical to a startup. I loved to work at
    Taliaz: I met amazing people and learned a lot.

    During my last three months at gizra, I worked at RealCommerce as a team leader and an extra three months as a
    freelance. Since I knew Drupal very good I helped a Drupal-based team inside the company to handle various tasks:
    fix bugs, implements new features, update the design and make sure that the \"best practices\" are implemented.

  It was <em>June 2011</em> and Rotchild st. will start to fill with tents. I
  just quit my job in <em>Pizza Hut</em> as a manager. Don't get me wrong - I
  love Pizza but for my professional life it seems that I can do more.
  I knew it. I'm learning how to program by my self from books since I was 15
  years old and now, 21 years old I can go for it. But... Who would take me
  without any formal education? Not to talk about bootcamps which at the time
  seems like something from the future. I need to start polish my CV and send
  it. It dosen't matter - just send it. Eventually, it will hit and destiny will
  shine upon me! </p>

  <p>
  I went to two job interviews. The first one was a small company - two people,
  which look unorthodox for a hi-tech company managers (but in a good way),
  two rooms and a single developer with a single HR manager. Seems cozy. The
  second one was at a company which look odd, not fully oreganized, uses a
  couple of technologies and located at <em>Petah Tivka</em>. Seems a bit
  frighten for someone without any expirence. As I walked home, I got a call
  from the first company - <em>gizra</em> and they told me I got the job. I was
  thrilled!
  </p>

  <p>
  At first, it was horrible. I got to work with something called <em>Drupal</em>, at
  time seems complex but in a look back it's one of the best thing Iv'e got to
  work with. In <em>gizra</em> all the myths about hi-tech companies are
  shuttered: you don't need to kill your self with long hours, the balance
  between personal life and professional life is at the top of priorities. Some
  times.
  </p>

  <p>
  In <em>gizra</em> I got to do amazing stuff - I worked on big and complex
  sites, I contributed back to open source projects, I got to write blog posts,
  I went to conferences and even orgeznied a couple by my self. And it's not
  because they were tasks that we have to do, it's because my managers believed
  that we need to contribute back to the community.

  <em>gizra</em> believed, and still believes, in automated QA, and taking care
  for the smallest details - even in the code comments which a lot of companies
  think it's redundent. I remember that CI, and automation were a huge part of
  the time estimation. Those things are not something you can see in a lot of
  companies - especially project based companies.
  </p>

  <p>
  The time in <em>gizra</em> will forever have a special place in my heart.
  Don't get me wrong, I left there for professional reason - I looked for more.
  Pretty funny that this is the same reason I came to <em>gizra</em> in the
  first place.

#    I joined gizra in June 2011, after working in Pizza Hut as a shift manager.

#    year and a half. Later on, I worked on other projects until I joined an open source project called
#    OpenScholar. The work on OS took around 4-5 years in which I lead developers, handled complex tasks, helped to
#    implement CI/CD projects, and worked directly with the team from Harvard. Except for that, most of the work in gizra
#    based on a contribution from the opensource community so it was natural, and the right thing to do, to give back to
#    the community: I talked on local meetups, created modules in Drupal, managed local events, mentored young developers
#    and much more.
