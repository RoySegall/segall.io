  After I got fired from Taliaz I started to look for a Job once more. The job search took around 3 months and I nailed
  a position in company I rather not specify. I decided to hide it from my resume since the job position was at a
  company that had nothing in which I believe: No CI, No PR and code reviews and not a single good principle for a
  project managing. After an unpleasant event that occur I decided to quit it and look for a better job.

  I arrived finally to Dreamed Diabetes, a company which developed an algorithm that can suggest a better insulin plans
  for patients with Type 1 Diabetes. This time I look for the right signals - All the best practices, a good challenge,
  Technologies I did not worked with, and a work life balance.

  In addition to all of the above there was one thing that I decided to pick this position - getting out of my comfort
  zone. Dreamed uses Windows as the OS for developing and the stack is ReactJS with Django. Technologies I did not had
  the chance to work with. The very best thing with getting of the comfort zone is that you get to do stuff you did not
  thought of before.

    Once I figured out I had enough with Drupal I joined a company called Taliaz. Taliaz's mission was to help people
    with hard depression. They managed to accomplish that by taking a swab sample from the patient, ask the patient a
    couple of questions, and after a couple of days the patient(or the doctor) will get a report with the best matching
    medicine. At the time I joined in, Taliaz decided to grow in start to develop all the products in-house instead of
    using an out-source solution. I helped to improve the current products: fix bugs, implement a couple of small
    features. In the last month at Taliaz, I started to write a new API based on Symfony which meant to serve all kind
    of application: Desktop, Mobile, Smart wearable devices etc.

    I got fired from Taliaz due to finance issues they had back then - pretty typical to a startup. I loved to work at
    Taliaz: I met amazing people and learned a lot.

    During my last three months at gizra, I worked at RealCommerce as a team leader and an extra three months as a
    freelance. Since I knew Drupal very good I helped a Drupal-based team inside the company to handle various tasks:
    fix bugs, implements new features, update the design and make sure that the \"best practices\" are implemented.

    I joined gizra in June 2011, after working in Pizza Hut as a shift manager.
    I had no real experience and until then all my coding stuff was a Hobie.
    In the beginning, I worked on a couple of projects but eventually, I worked on a QA site for medical questions for a
    year and a half. Later on, I worked on other projects until I joined an open source project called
    OpenScholar. The work on OS took around 4-5 years in which I lead developers, handled complex tasks, helped to
    implement CI/CD projects, and worked directly with the team from Harvard. Except for that, most of the work in gizra
    based on a contribution from the opensource community so it was natural, and the right thing to do, to give back to
    the community: I talked on local meetups, created modules in Drupal, managed local events, mentored young developers
    and much more.
