  After I got fired from Taliaz I started to look for a Job once more. The job search took around 3 months and I nailed
  a position in company I rather not specify. I decided to hide it from my resume since the job position was at a
  company that had nothing in which I believe: No CI, No PR and code reviews and not a single good principle for a
  project managing. After an unpleasant event that occur I decided to quit it and look for a better job.

  I arrived finally to Dreamed Diabetes, a company which developed an algorithm that can suggest a better insulin plans
  for patients with Type 1 Diabetes. This time I look for the right signals - All the best practices, a good challenge,
  Technologies I did not worked with, and a work life balance.

  In addition to all of the above there was one thing that I decided to pick this position - getting out of my comfort
  zone. Dreamed uses Windows as the OS for developing and the stack is ReactJS with Django. Technologies I did not had
  the chance to work with. The very best thing with getting of the comfort zone is that you get to do stuff you did not
  thought of before.

    Once I figured out I had enough with Drupal I joined a company called Taliaz. Taliaz's mission was to help people
    with hard depression. They managed to accomplish that by taking a swab sample from the patient, ask the patient a
    couple of questions, and after a couple of days the patient(or the doctor) will get a report with the best matching
    medicine. At the time I joined in, Taliaz decided to grow in start to develop all the products in-house instead of
    using an out-source solution. I helped to improve the current products: fix bugs, implement a couple of small
    features. In the last month at Taliaz, I started to write a new API based on Symfony which meant to serve all kind
    of application: Desktop, Mobile, Smart wearable devices etc.

    I got fired from Taliaz due to finance issues they had back then - pretty typical to a startup. I loved to work at
    Taliaz: I met amazing people and learned a lot.

    At my last 3 months over <em>gizra</em> I got a bonus from my CTO,
    <em>Amitai</em>: Another project company needed help with a <em>Drupal</em>
    based project and I was sent to the task. It was something that I did with a
    customer in the past, <em>Harvard</em>, which I need to do two stuff:
    consulting with issues which related to <em>Drupal</em> and managed other
    employee and help them to maintain the project.
  </p>

  <p>
  It was a very special time period for me: I was looking for a job and went to
  job interviews but yet, I was doing consulting for another company which I
  know nothing about their organization workflow. It felt to me that I need to
  join to another company, become a one of their oen for very short period time
  but still keep my eyes open for my next long term preofessional relationship.
  </p>

  <p>
  From the social prespective they were good, really! I felt I was at home and
  love the people. From my professional prespective I couldn't take it anymore -
  another <em>Drupal</em> project that has no CI nor automated tests. But, the
  team, project manager and the CTO was very helpful and even propose me a
  poisition. I declined because I was looking fo r something else.
  </p>

  <p>
  Each company Iv'e been to, even for a short period, I take the good stuff and
  try to look how it impacted me. From <em>Real Commerce</em> I took the ability
  to look beyond to simple developer point of view and can see how the feature,
  or the lack of infrastructure can hurt our development, got a better
  understand how <em>Drupal</em> can help big organizations in these days,
  especially when there are cool technologies like <em>NodeJS</em>.

  It was <em>June 2011</em> and Rotchild st. will start to fill with tents. I
  just quit my job in <em>Pizza Hut</em> as a manager. Don't get me wrong - I
  love Pizza but for my professional life it seems that I can do more.
  I knew it. I'm learning how to program by my self from books since I was 15
  years old and now, 21 years old I can go for it. But... Who would take me
  without any formal education? Not to talk about bootcamps which at the time
  seems like something from the future. I need to start polish my CV and send
  it. It dosen't matter - just send it. Eventually, it will hit and destiny will
  shine upon me! </p>

  <p>
  I went to two job interviews. The first one was a small company - two people,
  which look unorthodox for a hi-tech company managers (but in a good way),
  two rooms and a single developer with a single HR manager. Seems cozy. The
  second one was at a company which look odd, not fully oreganized, uses a
  couple of technologies and located at <em>Petah Tivka</em>. Seems a bit
  frighten for someone without any expirence. As I walked home, I got a call
  from the first company - <em>gizra</em> and they told me I got the job. I was
  thrilled!
  </p>

  <p>
  At first, it was horrible. I got to work with something called <em>Drupal</em>, at
  time seems complex but in a look back it's one of the best thing Iv'e got to
  work with. In <em>gizra</em> all the myths about hi-tech companies are
  shuttered: you don't need to kill your self with long hours, the balance
  between personal life and professional life is at the top of priorities. Some
  times.
  </p>

  <p>
  In <em>gizra</em> I got to do amazing stuff - I worked on big and complex
  sites, I contributed back to open source projects, I got to write blog posts,
  I went to conferences and even orgeznied a couple by my self. And it's not
  because they were tasks that we have to do, it's because my managers believed
  that we need to contribute back to the community.

  <em>gizra</em> believed, and still believes, in automated QA, and taking care
  for the smallest details - even in the code comments which a lot of companies
  think it's redundent. I remember that CI, and automation were a huge part of
  the time estimation. Those things are not something you can see in a lot of
  companies - especially project based companies.
  </p>

  <p>
  The time in <em>gizra</em> will forever have a special place in my heart.
  Don't get me wrong, I left there for professional reason - I looked for more.
  Pretty funny that this is the same reason I came to <em>gizra</em> in the
  first place.
