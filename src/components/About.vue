            <p class="text-2xl w-3/4 m-auto pb-4">
                Since I remember my self I know that I love to explore. Every time something electrical went down,
                everyone knew that they need to give it to me so I could tear it down and see the inside. Explore the
                anatomy and see the kit, the electrical components and I did not afraid for breaking stuff since the
                electrical item is going to garbage.

                Over the years, I change my position to the chair in front the desktop and started to learn by myself
                how to program. That eventually helped me land jobs in hi-tech companies and created sites for various
                customers (Harvard for example üôÑ).

            <p class="text-2xl w-3/4 m-auto block pb-4">
                In addition to my daily job I love to contribute to open source projects and always look for cutting
                edge technologies. Except for that, I own two cats, with my lovely fiance, which goes by the names
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tomandsamthecats/" class="underline">Tom and Sam</a>. The female cat,
                Tom, is a real lady while sam, the male cat, is a real trouble maker, but in a cute way üòÅ.
