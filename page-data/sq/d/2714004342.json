Then, I got fired.\nSurprisingly, I was looking for a job, again. Took me a couple of months but I found it. It was a, pardon my french,\ncrappy job. It was so bad I rather not talk about it, and delete any reference of me being employed there. After three\nmonths I decided to quit and look for another job.</p>\n<p>This time, I knew what I was looking for and the search was grueling, each place was not interested in my skills or it\nwas something I did not want to do. But then, like a ray of sunshine between a crack of clouds from a gray sky I found\nit - my next, and current position, at <em>Dreamed Diabetes</em>.</p>\n<p>Very similar to the previous job on the list, <em>Taliaz</em>, the work in <em>Dreamed Diabetes</em> is all about doing good: Helping\npeople with <em>Diabetes</em> to live better. It doing it by getting their diabetes information, process it with a smart\nalgorithm, and then provide a treatment plan which improves, and might saves, the patient's life. Surely, something not\neveryone can vouch for themself.</p>\n<p>The work in <em>Dreamed Diabetes</em> is achieved in technologies I could dreamed of at the time: <em>Python</em> and <em>React</em>, which\nthrilled me a lot. But, not only the technologies makes me happy - there's so much more. Seeing how people live with\ndiabetes and understanding that there's more than just inject themself <em>Insulin</em> was shocking. I won't go deep but I can\nsay that there's a whole new world that unveiled to me, something that doesn't teach you a lot in schools and that's a\nshame.</p>\n<p>We talked about the technical stuff, let's talk a bit about the people - wow! It's been a while since I found a place\nthat keeps so many smart people in one place (well, they have to if they doing such a noble goal). But besides them\nbeing smart I can say that they heart-warming, bear-care people with the feet on the ground. I do believe I found a\nplace that will forever stay in my heart.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Dreamed Diabetes","class":"dreamed-diabetes","years":2019,"logo":"dreamed-diabetes.png","position":"Developer","url":"https://dreamed-diabetes.com","title":"My first blog post"}},{"html":"<p>It true, I haven't been to a lot of companies over the years. I 'spent' 7 years at <em>gizra</em> while other people can work\nfor at least 3 companies. But on the other hand, working for a company for 7 straight years indicates loyalty, it's a\nbonus. But in my case, a lot of companies decided that my experience is not what they looking and skips to the next\ncontestant.</p>\n<p><em>Taliaz</em> is a different story. After being sick and tired for looking for a job a friend told me that he knows someone\nthat looks for a full-stack developer. I gave it a shot. The process was very quick and I felt that that company is\ndifferent from the other companies I interviewed. It was a small startup that started the expansion: hiring two people\nand aims for being bigger.</p>\n<p>It was exactly something I was looking for. Being at a position where you can make a real impact. No longer a project\nwith a company that after 1-2 years you don't have any relationship and the hard work you gave is not visible to your\neyes. If I can describe it, it's like saying goodbye from one of your children.</p>\n<p>At <em>Taliaz</em> I was given the honor of starting to re-write the product. Choosing the backend (Symfony in my case) while\nthe frontend will be chosen sometime in the future. In the beginning, I was looking for approval to do stuff. My CTO\ntold me that I don't need it. Just build it. If it will not fit, we'll remove it. Then, something happens - a switch\nwas turned on. From being used to wait for approval I needed to act fast and if something was bad, that's OK, we'll fix\nit and learn for the next time.</p>\n<p>But, it turns that nothing good was last forever and in my case, shorter than I ever expected. After two months, just\nwhen I started to warm up I got the bad news - I'm fired. It's because they were out of money - the expected funding has\nnot arrived.</p>\n<p>P.S - I forgot to tell you what's <em>Taliaz</em> purpose: they came up with an incredible solution - helping people with\ndepression to find the best matching medicine with fewer side effects. That job fits me well because I love 'doing good'\nfor other people.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Taliaz Health","class":"taliaz","years":2018,"logo":"taliaz.png","position":"Developer","url":"https://www.taliazhealth.com/","title":"My first blog post"}},{"html":"<p>At my last 3 months over <em>gizra</em>, I got a bonus from my CTO, <em>Amitai</em>: Another project company needed help with a\n<em>Drupal</em> project and I was sent to the task. It was something that I did with a customer in the past, <em>Harvard</em>, I\nneeded to do two stuff: consulting with issues which related to <em>Drupal</em>, managed other employee and help them to\nmaintain the project.</p>\n<p>It was a very special period for me: I was looking for a job and went to job interviews but yet, I was doing consulting\nfor another company which I know nothing about their organization workflow. It felt to me that I need to join another\ncompany, become one of their own for a very short period but still keep my eyes open for my next long term professional\nrelationship.</p>\n<p>From a social perspective, they were good! I felt I was at home and love the people. From my professional perspective, I\ncouldn't take it anymore - another <em>Drupal</em> project that has no CI nor automated tests. But, the team, project manager,\nand the CTO was very helpful and even propose a position. I declined because I was looking for something else.</p>\n<p>Each company I've has been to, even for a short period, I take the good stuff and try to look at how it impacted me.\nFrom <em>Real Commerce</em> I took the ability to look beyond to simple developer point of view and can see how the feature or\nthe lack of infrastructure can hurt the development, got a better understand how <em>Drupal</em> can help big organizations in\nthese days, especially when there are cool technologies like <em>NodeJS</em>.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Real Commerce","class":"rc","years":2018,"logo":"rc.png","position":"Consulting","url":"https://www.realcommerce.co.il/","title":"My first blog post"}},{"html":"<p>It was <em>June 2011</em> and Rotchild st. will start to fill with tents. I just quit my job in <em>Pizza Hut</em> as a manager. Don't\nget me wrong - I love Pizza but for my professional life it seems that I can do more. I knew it. I'm learning how to\nprogram by my self from books since I was 15 years old and now, 21 years old I can go for it. But... Who would take me\nwithout any formal education? Not to talk about boot camps which at the time seems like something from the future. I\nneed to start polishing my CV and send it. It doesn't matter - just send it. Eventually, it will hit and destiny will\nshine upon me!</p>\n<p>I went to two job interviews. The first one was a small company - two people, which look unorthodox for a hi-tech\ncompany managers (but in a good way), two rooms, and a single developer with a single HR manager. Seems cozy. The second\none was at a company that looks odd, not fully organized, uses a couple of technologies, and located at <em>Petah Tivka</em>.\nSeems a bit frightening for someone without any experience. As I walked home, I got a call from the first company -\n<em>gizra</em> and they told me I got the job. I was thrilled!</p>\n<p>At first, it was horrible. I got to work with something called <em>Drupal</em>, at the time seems complex but in a look back\nit's one of the best things I've got to work with. In <em>gizra</em> all the myths about hi-tech companies are shuttered: you\ndon't need to kill your self with long hours, the balance between personal life and professional life is at the top of\npriorities.</p>\n<p>In <em>gizra</em> I got to do amazing stuff - I worked on big and complex sites, I contributed back to open source projects, I\ngot to write blog posts, I went to conferences and even organized a couple by my self (with help from other people as\nwell). And it's not because they were\ntasks that we have to do, it's because my managers believed that we need to contribute back to the community. <em>gizra</em>\nbelieved, and still believes, in automated QA, and taking care of the smallest details - even in the code comments\nwhich a lot of companies think it's redundant. I remember that CI and automation were a huge part of the time\nestimation. Those things are not something you can see in a lot of companies - especially project-based companies.</p>\n<p>The time in <em>gizra</em> will forever have a special place in my heart. Don't get me wrong, I quit due to professional\nreason - I looked for more. Pretty funny that this is the same reason I came to <em>gizra</em> in the first place.</p>","frontmatter":{"name":"Gizra","class":"gizra","years":2011,"logo":null,"position":"Lead developer","url":"https://www.gizra.com/","title":"My first blog post"}}]},"dreamed":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/0bb8f82eecaa3b8775b38ac0674e9a31/ee604/dreamed-diabetes.png"}}},"gizra":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/51be6149bb129d049f4bdc452a9f5ffd/497c6/gizra.png"}}},"rc":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/afd4b5e3f1c91986c00f107849fcd640/f4c69/rc.png"}}},"taliaz":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/73930864a5bcfde5f611f57e2f05b754/497c6/taliaz.png"}}}}}
