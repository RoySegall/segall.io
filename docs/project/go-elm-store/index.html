<h4 id="background">Background</h4>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the technologies - <code>Go</code> and <code>Elm</code>. Well, you might have heard of <code>Go</code> before(if not, I&rsquo;ll get to that) but
what is <code>Elm</code>? <code>Elm</code> is a functional programming language which looks like <code>Haskell</code> and eventually compiles into <code>JS</code>.
I came across this language while working at <code>gizra</code>. You can read
<a href="https://www.gizra.com/content/elmlang-headless-drupal/">here</a>about why choosing <code>Elm</code> and not go with the flow and use
<code>React</code> or maybe the new version of <code>Angular</code>.</p>

<p>At the same time, I heard about <code>Go</code> - a language created by Google which solved the problems Google had. I decided to
take a look and see what it all about. I saw a nice language, not that complex which looks to me as the future.</p>

<p>I did not have a lot of experience with <code>Elm</code> since the projects I worked on did not use <code>Elm</code>. I took the challenge for
creating a small project with <code>Elm</code> and this my story with <code>Elm</code> and <code>Go</code>.</p>

<h4 id="the-idea">The idea</h4>

<p>Half a year before the project conceived there was a trend of fake Oreilly&rsquo;s books that make fun of the general look -
on the cover, there&rsquo;s an animal that doesn&rsquo;t have any connection to the main topic of the book, a title, and subtitle
that comes to elaborate on the content.</p>

<p>A friend of mine collected all the cover of the books. I decided to make an e-commerce site that sells the books.
Overall, I tried to create a good experience with seeing all the books, showing a beautiful cart and having a cool
checkout process with cool animations.</p>

<h4 id="my-two-cents-on-the-stack">My two cents on the stack</h4>

<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s talk about the DB:</strong> First, I want to talk about the DB I choose - <code>RethinkDB</code>. It&rsquo;s a <code>NoSQL</code> DB which has
orientation for <code>realtime</code> events and has an awesome query language. It&rsquo;s also very easy to set up and have a built-in
UI. But, the company behind the DB had some financial issues and shut down. Of course, the community stepped in but, for
some reasons, the DB lost his fame and <code>MongoDB</code> remained the dominant DB in the NoSQL DBs. Personally, I love this DB
and think it&rsquo;s a good DB but, you can&rsquo;t use a product like that in a production environment: security issues, a product
that is not backed by a company is not a good selling item when arriving to do a pitch in front of client or CV bodies.</p>

<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s talk about the backend</strong>: Well, the work with <code>Go</code> was very refreshing in compare when working with languages
like <code>PHP</code> or <code>Python</code> at the time: I liked the typing system, the dependency manager(though in big projects it can get
very complex but that&rsquo;s for another story), and the fact that the deployment process is very easy - compile the file and
run as a service.</p>

<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s talk about the frontend</strong>: Well, <code>Elm</code> is not an easy language, IMO. The work with <code>Elm</code> was hard. Every time I
approached to do something it was very complicated; Nothing was easy with <code>Elm</code>. But, if you thought that programming
in <code>Elm</code> disables the need for writing <code>JS</code> code you are wrong. If we need to access local storage in the browser, or
maybe interact with a <code>JS</code> package that we found first - we would need to write <code>JS</code> code for that. IMO, I would not
recommend <code>Elm</code> as my first choice for writing apps.</p>
