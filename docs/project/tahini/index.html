<h4 id="background">Background</h4>

<p>After I started to work at <code>Taliaz</code> we planned on replacing the current architecture. Up until then, their tools were
developed by a 3rd party company. The products developed in <code>Yii</code> and the backend written in another framework
(which I don&rsquo;t remember) - pretty much a mess.</p>

<p>After working on the products - fixing some bugs, adding some minor features and preparing for some ISO standards -
we, or should I say me, started to look deeper on how to replace the current architecture. Stay tuned, it&rsquo;s going to be
very interesting.</p>

<h4 id="the-idea">The idea</h4>

<p>We needed to solve one a major problem. You might think that creating an API that can serve any kind of app - desktop,
mobile, watch etc. - would be the problem. No, any API can do this. We needed to base the API on a framework which
probably stays relevant for years, and won&rsquo;t be absolute, or make you twitch your nose once you here the name,
like <code>YII</code>.</p>

<p>I looked over the web for the best frameworks. My first choice was <code>Symfony</code>. Since version 4 was released a couple of
months ago it looked like a good choice. Sure, <code>laravel</code> or <code>lumen</code> were considered, but, when I looked on the
architecture of <code>laravel</code> something felt wrong to me:</p>

<ul>
<li>The way you define a router in <code>symfony</code> is pretty much easy while in <code>laravel</code> you need to define a router manually
(in addition for creating the class of the router).</li>
<li>Defining a service in <code>symfony</code> is very easy - just create the class in the <code>src</code> folder and you go to go while in
<code>laravel</code> you need to manually specify it. When injecting a service to another service you need to write more code.</li>
<li>In <code>laravel</code> DB models interactions defined in two places: migration handlers for altering the DB and <code>php</code> classes
for interacting with the <code>ORM</code>. In <code>symfony</code>, the entity class and the DB modeling happens in one class and the
migration files generated by a nice command.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are three issues that look minor but when I want to develop something I&rsquo;m looking for writing less code as I
progress.</p>

<p>My CTO said to me: &ldquo;Go for it. Start to write it with <code>Symfony</code>&rdquo;. After two weeks I had an API with very basic stuff -
user authentication based on access token and a couple of entities. Then, I got the bad news: I&rsquo;m being fired due to
financial issues the company is struggling with.</p>

<p>After digesting the bad news my CTO told me something good: &ldquo;You can take the work and open source it. Just remove any
logic that relates to us&rdquo;. Yes, finally I can give back what I&rsquo;ve done to the world. I don&rsquo;t know if someone will use
it, but it&rsquo;s there.</p>

<p>I named the projectÂ§ <code>tahini</code> because I love it. <code>tahini</code> used me for another project -
<a href="/project/financeular">Financeular</a> so the work I did never really went to the trashcan.</p>

<h4 id="my-two-cents-on-the-stack">My two cents on the stack</h4>

<p>Well, after working with <code>Drupal</code> for a long time, creating a slim API&rsquo;s, DB architecture based on classes, and much
more was very fun and delightful. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that this would be a good selection for future products if someone
wants to base their work on <code>PHP</code>.</p>
