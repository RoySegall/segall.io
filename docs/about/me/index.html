<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>I was born on June 25th, 1989. When I was 12 years old, I started to work on sites related to my interest: Games and TV
shows. When I was 13 years old I joined a local community which supported and translated
<a href="https://invisioncommunity.com/features/content/#forums">Invision power board</a> system. In the meanwhile, I created
scripts for fun.</p>

<p>In Israel, there is conscription which forced me to join the <code>IDF</code>. At the age of 21, when I left the army I started to
work in <code>Pizza Hut</code> as a shift manager but felt that this is not the best fit me for. I quit and started to look for a
job in the web world. <code>gizra</code> decided to hire me and to teach me all the knew in the tech world, and Drupal
specifically.
I started a joiner, moved to lead developer and finally I was a lead developer.</p>

<p>After 7 years at <code>gizra</code>, I decided to quit since I was too much in the comfort zone - and that’s not a good thing. I
worked with <code>Real commerce</code> as a team leader and then joined <code>Taliaz</code>. In <code>taliaz</code> I was a single developer, alongside
the
CTO, and solved various problems.</p>

<p>If you want to read more about my professional you can see that on the front page.</p>

<h2 id="computerised-dreams">Computerised dreams</h2>

<p>Once upon a day, I decided to have a cool email address. I look for the domain <code>segall.com</code> but this was taken. So I
looked for other domains and eventually found <code>segall.io</code>. If you want to use Google’s services with a custom domain you
need to register as a business. I thought of a cool name and found out that Computerised dreams are pretty awesome.</p>

<p>It’s not just a name - it’s a way of creating products and solutions. Every time someone approaches me and asked me on
how his app should look or act, or maybe a customer had an idea but never knew how to describe it I use to give them the
next tip: Close your eyes and start to imagine how your up should look like. How your brand new site looks and behaves
in your deepest dreams.</p>

<p>My mission, as a developer and someone that knows a thing or two about computers, is to take your wildest dreams and
turn them to something real.</p>

<p>This is why I choose this name.</p>
