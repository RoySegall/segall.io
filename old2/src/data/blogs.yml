  intro: "
  Here’s a common problem with aliases:

  users/[user:name]/blog – This is a page defined by Panels. It shows a list of latest blog posts
  users/[user:name]/blog/[node:title] – This is the alias of the node that is a blog post. But if you will try to use it, Drupal thinks you refer to the Panels page, and shows you the lastest blog posts, instead of the node
