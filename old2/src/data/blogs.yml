  intro: "
  I've been working with Django for the past year as my daily driver. Up until then, I worked with Drupal, Symfony and
  a bit of Laravel. One of the most common things between all of the above, and also for others frameworks, is that
  eventually there’s a file that contains all the routes and it’s can get big.

  intro: "
  Currently, I’m working for a company named Dreamed Diabetes. My daily drivers are Django and React. But, before I used
  those awesome technologies I used something less cool — PHP, mainly Drupal, but also Symfony and Laravel. I said less
  cool because let’s face it — PHP is the language that people love to hate.

  intro: "
  I love Apple products but mostly, what I use every day for making money, is an operating system. I love Mac OSX, I
  think it’s one of the best OS for web development. No, Microsoft Windows is not good enough IMO for web development.
  One of the things that doesn’t exist on the Mac OS is a proper image gallery.

  So what is a bot? If you’ve ever said Hey Siri, OK Google, Hey Cortona, or Alexa, then you have interacted with a bot.
  That bot received an input, returned an output - it woke you up, reminded you of something, sent an email, or ordered
  a new book from Amazon - and you if you’re lucky, a drone delivered it!

  intro: "
  For a traditional Drupal site, we don’t need to handle authentication, because Drupal has our back - a user submits
  the login form, gets a cookie, and starts using the awesome site. But what about decoupled sites? How can we
  authenticate the user?

  Drupal-8-manina is at its highest. Modules are being ported, blog posts are being written, and new sites are being
  coded, so we in Gizra decided to join the party.

  We started with a simple site that will replace an existing static site. But we needed to migrate node attachments,
  and we just couldn’t find an existing solution. Well, it was time to reach out to the community

  intro: "
  You might have heard of Burning Man. Basically it’s a lot of hippies settling down in the desert for a few days,
  setting up small camps with different themes that make up a big, temporary city.

  It’s not for me.

  intro: "
  The first time I heard about Behat was at DrupalCon Munich 2012. Since then use of Behat has grown exponentially and
  the tools it can be integrate with grew as well. With Behat we can test the markup of a page - pretty neat, right?

  intro: "
  Here’s a common problem with aliases:

  users/[user:name]/blog – This is a page defined by Panels. It shows a list of latest blog posts
  users/[user:name]/blog/[node:title] – This is the alias of the node that is a blog post. But if you will try to use it, Drupal thinks you refer to the Panels page, and shows you the lastest blog posts, instead of the node
